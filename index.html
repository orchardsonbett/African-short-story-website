<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>These are the stories passed down orally from generation to generation in different communities within the African continent.
Traditionally they were told in the evening to children by their grandparents to teach them virtues they would require in their lives as well as entertain them.</p>
<p>We present these stories to you to teach the lessons the elders once did and ensure that the African culture is preserved.
